# Modify or remove alternative payment buttons

Merchants sometimes want the alternative payment methods listed at the top of
checkout removed.  These are often PayPal or Amazon.

## Solution

You have a couple means at your disposal:

* Remove liquid drop for `{{ alternative_payment_methods }}`.
* Hiding with inline CSS.
* Modifying with a liquid filter.

### Remove liquid drop

In the the checkout.liquid file, remove `{{ alternative_payment_methods }}`. This
will remove the DOM element which wraps the output as well.

### Hiding with CSS

Without any DOM dependencies, we can simply wrap the liquid drop in a `span` and hide it.

```
<style>
.hidden {
  display: none !important;
}
</style>
```

And the html: `<span class="hidden">{{ alternative_payment_methods }}</span>`.

### Modifying with a liquid filter

This is advanced level stuff, but you can actual modify the output of `{{ alternative_payment_methods }}`.
Since this is just a liquid object that outputs a string of HTML, you are able to use
[string filters](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/filters/string-filters).

**Example**: Replace the PayPal button image

If you wanted to change the PayPal image `src` attribute, you can grab
a new URL at [PayPal's updated logos page](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/logos-buttons) or
grab one in a different language from [PayPal's archive site](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/archive/buttons/).

```javascript
{% assign oldLogo = "https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/btn/btn_checkout_pp_142x27.png" %}
{% assign newLogo = "https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/i/buttons/ppcredit-logo-small.png" %}
{{ alternative_payment_methods | replace: oldLogo, newLogo }}
```

## FAQs

**Q**: When do these alternative payment buttons show up?

**A**: These buttons will appear in the header of checkout **if** the customer
was not shown them on the storefront, typically seen on the cart page.  

More specifically: if the liquid object `{{ content_for_additional_checkout_buttons }}` was not rendered in a template file or `theme.liquid` during the customer's session, then the `{{ alternative_payment_methods }}` liquid object will output the
payment buttons at checkout.

There is some back-end magic going on that keeps track of whether that liquid object was rendered.  This will also explain a lot of
"randomness" in their appearance you may _feel_ you are witnessing.  Themes that have a direct to checkout flow, or merchants using the Buy Button channel will see these buttons the most.

**Q**: Why are these buttons there at all?

**A**: Shopify has an agreement with PayPal and Amazon to have these buttons appear
in every initialized shop.  Removing them is totally fine though (confirmed with legal).
